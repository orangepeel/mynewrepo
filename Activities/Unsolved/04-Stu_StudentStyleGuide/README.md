# HTML Style Guide

The best way to get used to rapid prototyping is to practice!  Let's build a HTML page with UI style guide content.

## Instructions

- Create a basic HTML page that gives information about your previous UI project style guide.

- "Content is king" - think about what information people would want to see on a html Style Guide, and include that information.

- Use the appropriate HTML elements as you build your page. You should include following elements. Add more if you wish.

- HTML Should include:

- Semantic Tags.
  - header.
  - nav.
  - section.
  - article.
  - footer.

- Typography.
  - H1.
  - H2.
  - H3.
  - H4.
  - H5.
  - H6.

- Include interesting elements from your UI project.  

**Bonus:**

- Create a contact form with labels and fields for an email address and a message.
