# Code Exploration

Thinking semantically about how the content in your application is layed out is tied to information architecture.  Logical grouping of content allows HTML to be readable, organized, and easily maintained.  Let's explore how content gets tagged and built with HTML.

## Instructions

- Open the HTML file in VS Code.

- Discuss with a partner how the page will look upon opening it in a browser.  Make a sketch if you'd like.

- Answer the following questions.  As you explore, feel free to alter the code and experiment and/or add comments.

  1. What is the significance of the `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` tags?

  1. What visual element does the `<hr>` tag render to the page?  What semantics should the `<hr>` element provide?

  1. The first paragraph element has three additional tags nested in the text.  List the tags used and their purpose.

  1. What is the significance of the `<table>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>` elements?

  1. Briefly summarize how to use `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` tags to structure a table.

  1. List the tags used within the `<form>` tag and their semantic significance and/or the visual element they provide.
