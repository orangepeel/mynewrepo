# Inline Styling

In this activity, you will practice using inline styling.

## Instructions

- Open `inline.html` within your editor and style the following elements using inline CSS.

- Make the `<div>` background color grey.

- Make the `<h1>` bold.

- Make the `<p>` element pink.

- Open up your `index.html` file within your browser to see the changes.

## Bonus

- Create a new `<div>` and style it so that it has a solid, black, 5 pixel wide border around it.

- Within this new `<div>`, create an ordered list with five elements.

- Each list item should have a different `background-color`.

- Each item in the ordered list should have the same `font-size` as the `<h1>` element. Think about how to code this once instead of on each list item.

## Hints

- Visit [W3 Schools - CSS Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp) to explore the difference style tags.
