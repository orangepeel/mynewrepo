# Style Tag

You will now style an HTML page using the `<style>` tag.

## Instructions

- Open up `internal.html` within your editor and, using the `<style>` tag, style the following elements:

  - Style the `<h2>` with italics.

  - Underline the `<p>` element.

## Bonus

- Create a [HTML Table](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) with three columns and five rows.

  - The column headers should be your favorite films, foods, and books.

  - The rows should contain matching entries.

- The table should take up the entire width of the webpage.

- The table and cells within the table should have a solid, black, 1 pixel wide black border.

- The headers of the table should be bolded and uppercase. The text should be white and the background should be black.

- The text of the rows should be centered within their individual cells.

## Hints

- If you are unsure of how to adjust one of the properties, practice Google-Fu!
