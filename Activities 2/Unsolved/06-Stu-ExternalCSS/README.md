# External CSS

You will now practice linking an external CSS sheet and style an HTML page using it.

## Instructions

- Create a file called `style.css` within the same folder as `external.html`.

- Open `external.html` within an editor as well as within your browser.

  - Add a `<link>` element within the `<head>` section.

  - Add the `href` attribute to the `<link>` element and set it equal to `style.css`.

  - Add the `type` attribute and set it to the correct value.

  - Add the `rel` attribute and set it to the correct value.

- Use CSS rules in `style.css` to style the following elements/

  - `<h1>` should be given a `font-size` of `60px`

  - `<p>` should be given a `font-family` of "Courier New" and the text should be colored red.

- Refresh your browser to see the changes.

## Bonus

- Create a [HTML form](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) which will take in some user input.

  - Add an `<input>` element with the `type` of "text" to accept an username.

  - Next, create one more `<input>` element with the `type` of "password". This will make it so the text typed will be hidden from view.

- All `<input>` elements should have a `width` of 300 pixels and have a light grey `background-color`, and should have a darker grey `border` with [rounded corners](https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/CSS3_borders.asp).

- Finish things off by creating a [HTML button](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp). This button will be green, with no border, rounded corners, have a top margin of 10 pixels, and says "SUBMIT".
